<h1 id="introduction" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Introduction</h1>
  Welcome to Paladin, the open source IDE for BeOS and Haiku! BeIDE, the 
  venerated development environment for BeOS, was based on CodeWarrior by 
  Metrowerks. It was a good commercial product distributed with BeOS, but with 
  the loss of Be, Inc. it has not seen further development or changes in its 
  licensing. Until now, there has not been a suitable replacement. Paladin is the 
  spiritual successor to BeIDE, building upon BeIDE's features, doing away with 
  its quirks, and streamlining C/C++ development as much as possible.<br>
  <br>
  As of this writing, primary development efforts have been placed on the 
  project manager, but Paladin also has an excellent editor, PalEdit. It is 
  based on the excellent Pe editor written by Maarten Hekkelman. As development 
  continues, more noticeable differences between the two will be seen.<br>
  <br>
  Although BeIDE was an excellent development environment for its time, its feature set is sparse for modern developers. Paladin's feature set includes:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Full support for BeOS R5, Zeta, and Haiku</li>
    <li>Command-line build support</li>
    <li>Multithreaded builds</li>
    <li>Revision control-friendly project files</li>
    <li>More run options for projects</li>
    <li>Explicit support for debugging with gdb under Haiku</li>
    <li>Bundled helper tools</li>
    <li>Streamlined project settings</li>
    <li>Out-of-the-box support for Lex and Yacc</li>
    <li>Support for text and binary resource files</li>
    <li>Projects can include notes and other files that aren't source code</li>
    <li>Project templates</li>
    <li>Out-of-the-box makefile generation</li>
    <li>Integrated source code management</li>
    <li>1-click project backups</li>
  </ul>
  
<h1 id="development-with-paladin" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Development with Paladin</h1>
<h2 id="starting-a-new-project" style="margin-top: 5px;">Starting a New Project</h2>
  When starting a new project, Paladin will need a little bit of information 
  from you: the name and kind of project you are starting, its name, where you 
  want to create the project's folder, and the name of the executable.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/CreateProjectWindow.png" alt="Create Project window" style="margin-left: 50px;"><br>
  <br>
  Choosing the proper project type is important – the compiler and linker use 
  different settings for each kind of project and may produce unexpected build 
  problems. If the Create Project Folder box is checked, your project's folder 
  will be created in the location you choose and will have the same name as that 
  of your project. Creating <code>MyProject</code> in <code>/boot/home/projects 
  </code>will result in a project file being created in the folder <code>
  /boot/home/projects/MyProject</code>. All project filenames are, by default, 
  created with the <code>.pld</code> extension. The Project Type menu gives you 
  the option to create your project from a template, saving you from retyping 
  the same boilerplate code each time. You can even create your own project 
  templates. Your project can also utilize source control. It is highly 
  recommended, but it is not required. Paladin currently supports the Subversion 
  and Mercurial tools.

<h2 id="the-project-window" style="margin-top: 20px;">The Project Window</h2>
  Once a project has been created, you will be shown a project window. Depending 
  on what project template you have chosen, the project window may or may not 
  have files in it. From here, you will want to add some files to your project 
  and, depending on what system components (Translation Kit, etc.) you may need 
  to change what system libraries are used by your project. There is quite a lot 
  of power hidden just out of sight in the project window. Let's take a quick 
  look at it:<br>
  <img src="images/ProjectWindowTour.png" alt="Project Window tour" style="margin-left: 50px;"><br>
  Not pictured above are two other types of entries: missing files and 
  unsupported files. Missing files are listed in gray and are italicized. Files 
  which are not associated with builds are shown as up-to-date and will 
  otherwise be ignored. See further below for more information on supported file 
  types.

<h2 id="adding-files-and-groups" style="margin-top: 20px;">Adding Files and Groups</h2>
<img src="images/PopulatedProjectWindow.png" alt="Populated Project Window" style="float: left; padding-right: 9px;">
  <p>Paladin supports many different kinds of files for use in projects. Adding 
  a file to your project is as simple as dragging it to the project window and 
  dropping it there. Alternatively, if you prefer to use a more traditional 
  method, you can add files to your project by choosing Add Files from the 
  Project menu.</p>
  <p>You can also drag and drop entire a folder to add its contents to your 
  project. Note that certain files will not be added, namely, Paladin and BeIDE 
  projects and the folders used by the Subversion, Git, Mercurial, and CVS 
  source control programs for holding repository information, e.g. .svn folders. 
  Build files use by the command-line build tools jam and make are also ignored. 
  When a folder is dropped onto the project window, each subfolder will be given 
  its own group.</p>
  <p>Projects have no practical limit to the number of files they can contain. 
  As a result, having one hundred or more files is both possible and somewhat 
  unwieldy. Although you can sort your files, you can also create groups to 
  better organize your projects.</p>
  <p>Removing files is just as easy. Select the files you wish to remove and 
  either hit Alt+Delete on the keyboard or choose Remove Selected Files from the 
  Project menu. You can even click while holding down the Shift or Alt keys to 
  select multiple files at once.</p>
  <p><i>Note: There is a known display bug in BeOS R5 and Zeta which does not 
  properly show the keyboard shortcut for Remove Selected Files. This issue is 
  being addressed in Haiku.</i></p>
  <p>To create a group, click on a file which you would like to belong to the 
  new group and then choose Create New Group from the Project menu. 
  Alternatively, you can right-click on the file item and choose Create New 
  Group. All files below your selection will also belong to this new group. To 
  remove a group, drag all of its files to another group.</p>

<h2 id="supported-file-types" style="margin-top: 20px;">Supported File Types</h2>
  All file types are identified by their extensions. Unsupported file types are 
  ignored. This is actually a feature – you can add TODO lists, e-mails and 
  whatever other files you might need to be associated with your project and 
  have easy access to them. Paladin will open them with their associated editor 
  when you double-click on them.<br>
<table style="background-color: #eeeeee; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 15px;">

</table>
  <b>Tip</b>: While you can certainly add a source file's header to your 
  project, it can be just as easily accessed by clicking on the file and hitting 
  Alt-Tab on the keyboard. This makes header files still easily accessible 
  without making it harder to find regular source files. Alt-Tab also does this 
  from within the PalEdit editor.

<h3 id="a-note-about-file-paths" style="margin-top: 20px;">A Note About File Paths</h3>
  Paladin stores the location of your project's files when it adds them to it. 
  Any files that are kept either in your project's folder or in a folder 
  underneath it are stored with paths relative to the project file. Any project 
  files that are stored somewhere else are tracked using absolute file paths. 
  This means that you should store all of your project file at the top of the 
  folder hierarchy for your project. This will allow you to move a project 
  around and its files won't be suddenly missing.

<h2 id="using-system-libraries" style="margin-top: 20px;">Using System Libraries</h2>
  <img src="images/LibraryWindow.png" alt="Library window" style="float: right; padding-left: 9px;">
  <p>One notable deviation from BeIDE's workflow is how Paladin works with 
  libraries installed in the usual system locations, i.e. <code>
  /boot/home/config/lib</code> and <code>/boot/develop/lib/x86</code>. Libraries 
  found here are added using a separate window. The Libraries window can be 
  found by choosing Change System Libraries from the Project menu.</p>
  <p>Instead of having to manually add system libraries to your project by the 
  same means as all of your other files, all that is needed is to check the 
  entry for a particular library you wish to be linked into your project. They 
  are listed and grouped by order of location – all libraries kept in <code>
  /boot/develop/lib/x86</code> are listed first group and those stored in <code>
  /boot/home/config/lib</code> are listed further down in the second group. 
  Under Haiku, three groups are used, and libraries found in <code>
  /boot/common/lib</code> are listed in between the other two groups.</p>
  <p>Static libraries in these locations are also listed. Should you wish to add 
  your own static libraries to a project, simply add them to your project just 
  like any other file and they will be linked at the proper time.</p>

<h2 id="project-settings" style="margin-top: 20px;">Project Settings</h2>
  Most of the settings for your project can be accessed from the Project 
  Settings window. They are divided  between two tabs: the General tab and the 
  Build tab.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/GeneralProjectSettings.png" alt="Project Settings, part 1">
  <img src="images/BuildProjectSettings.png" alt="Project Settings, part 2">
  <br>
  <p>From the General tab, it is possible to change your project's target type 
  (application, shared library, static library, kernel driver), the name of the 
  executable that Paladin will build, and any extra include paths your project 
  needs. Normally, it will not be necessary to change the include paths because 
  any time a file is added to a project, its location is added to the list. 
  Still, should the need arise, the paths can be changed.</p>
  <p>The Build tab contains settings that you may need to change during the 
  course of the development cycle. Compiler optimization can be set to None, 
  Some, More, and Full. Debugging information dramatically increases the size of 
  the executable, but it also allows the debugger to show the exact location in 
  the original source file when stepping through – a highly valuable tool. 
  Profiling information is for use with bprof to find out where your program 
  spends most of its time working and is available for BeOS R5 and Zeta. In 
  addition to these options, if there are other options you wish to include, 
  they can be added in the text boxes provided.</p>

<h2 id="running-your-project" style="margin-top: 20px;">Running Your Project</h2>
  <p>In addition to keyboard shortcuts to build and run your project, Paladin 
  provides other options which speed up development. These consist of opening 
  the debugger at the starting point of your program, running your program while 
  logging any console printing it does, and being able to choose command-line 
  arguments with which your program will be started.</p>
  <p>While Paladin's target for development is Haiku, it supports Zeta and BeOS 
  R5, as well. It supports both bdb, the BeOS debugger, and Haiku's gdb. If 
  debugger information is not already built into the program, it will be enabled 
  and your program will be rebuilt before being executed. You will, however, be 
  given the option to not run in the debugger before this is done.</p>
  <p>While it is currently not possible for Paladin to start the Terminal, have 
  it launch your program, and then stay open after your program exits, it is 
  nonetheless possible to obtain the benefits of doing so by choosing Run 
  Logged. Your program will run and when it quits, Paladin will display a log of 
  everything your program has printed to the Terminal. From there, you can 
  peruse it at your leisure or select everything and drag it to the Desktop to 
  save it into a file.</p>
  <p>For easier testing of applications which can take command-line arguments, 
  Paladin allows you to set these arguments for when your program is run. Note 
  that these arguments are persistent and are saved from one session to another 
  in order to save typing. Additionally, these arguments are utilized whenever 
  your program is run from Paladin, regardless of the mode (debugger, logged, 
  etc.).</p>

<h2 id="dealing-with-errors" style="margin-top: 20px;">Dealing with Errors</h2>
  Not everything builds on the first try, so every developer has to deal with 
  build errors. Paladin deals with errors in the same way that BeIDE did: 
  displaying a window containing a list of each error given to it by the build 
  tools. While warnings will not stop Paladin from continuing to build a 
  project, if an error occurs, Paladin will stop the build so that the errors 
  can be corrected. Errors are listed in pink; warnings are listed in yellow. 
  Sometimes errors or warnings are generated that take up two lines. In these 
  cases, one part will be in yellow and the other will merely be white. 
  Double-clicking on an error or warning will open up the file containing it in 
  the editor. The Copy to Clipboard button will copy all visible errors and/or 
  warnings to the system clipboard for pasting into other documents.<br><br>
  <img src="images/ErrorWindow.png" alt="Error window">

<h2 id="integrated-source-control" style="margin-top: 20px;">Using the Integrated Source Control</h2>
  <p>Experienced developers are, by and large, familiar with using source 
  control tools. These tools are designed to manage many developers working on 
  the same project at the same time without stepping on each others' toes much. 
  While these tools, also known as source control managers (SCMs), were 
  originally designed with many developers in mind, there is little reason for a 
  single developer to not use source control except for perhaps laziness and/or 
  ignorance.</p>
  <p>Many source control systems exist. The oldest are rcs and CVS. CVS is still 
  in current use by many projects, but it is not very well loved. Subversion, 
  abbreviated svn, was written as the proper way to implement CVS and improves 
  upon it considerably. These SCMs are designed with a single central repository 
  from which each developer checks in and checks out changes. More recently, 
  many other distributed SCMs have come onto the scene. These give each 
  developer a complete copy of the source tree, enabling a greater amount of 
  flexibility with which to work. The most popular of these are Darcs, Bazaar, 
  Git, and Mercurial. As of this writing, Haiku supports CVS, Subversion, 
  Mercurial, and Git. Paladin currently supports Subversion and Mercurial with 
  Git support coming in the very near future.</p>
  <p>Source control in Paladin is as much the same between tools as possible. 
  Project-wide operations, such as checking out and committing changes, can be 
  found in the Source Control submenu of the Project menu. Operations which work 
  on individual files are more easily accessed via the right-click context menu 
  in the  file list of the project window. The conceptual model used with 
  Paladin's source control tools fits working with Mercurial, however Subversion 
  will work just as well. While not all functionality of each SCM can be used 
  from Paladin, the day-to-day operations needed will work well and will save 
  the unfamiliar from having to learn the command-line methods until they wish 
  to do so.</p>
  <p>For more information on how to use source control systems in general, an 
  excellent tutorial can be found <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/Tutorial">at the Mercurial site</a>.</p>

<h2 id="scripting" style="margin-top: 20px;">Scripting with Paladin</h2>
  Many graphical development environments either attempt to integrate larger 
  script-based build solutions &mdash; such as make, jam, and others &mdash; 
  into the environment. Far too often, though, the integration isn't done well 
  enough to be useful to the developer. Paladin is intended to be able to handle 
  most projects. In order to support complex build tasks, like multiple targets 
  and targets depending on other targets, for example, would require Paladin to 
  sacrifice much of the simplicity it provides. Instead, Paladin does the 
  reverse: it makes itself work well within these more complex build systems. 
  This is done with command line arguments for starting Paladin. This means of 
  starting Paladin can also make reporting bugs in Paladin much easier.
<table style="background-color: #eeeeee; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
	<tr style="background-color: #e0e0e0; text-align: center;">
		<td style="min-width: 250px;"><b>Command</b></td>
		<td><b>Does what</b></td>
	</tr><tr>
		<td><code>Paladin [<i>projectpath</i>]</code></td>
    <td>Runs Paladin and if a project is specified, opens it. If not, the Start 
    window is displayed. If the project desired is kept within the default 
    projects folder used by Paladin, the name of the project can be used instead 
    of the entire path.</td>
	</tr><tr>
		<td><code>Paladin -b [-r] <i>projectpath</i></code></td>
    <td>Builds the specified project and exits. Errors and warnings are printed 
    on stderr. Adding the -r switch forces a complete rebuild.</td>
	</tr><tr>
    <td><code>Paladin -d [-v] [<i>projectpath</i>]</code></td>
    <td>Starts Paladin in debug mode, which prints information  to the console 
    needed by Paladin's developers for handling bug reports. Adding -v generates 
    additional information. If a project is specified, it is opened, but if not, 
    the Start window is displayed.</td>
  </tr><tr>
		<td><code>Paladin -h</code></td><td>Shows command line help.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<h2 id="program-settings" style="margin-top: 20px;">Program Settings</h2>
  Seeing how not everyone works the same way, Paladin features some options to 
  be able to customize the environment to your liking. The Program Settings 
  window allows you to choose the place where your projects are stored and the 
  location for project backups. For machines with more than one processor, 
  Paladin creates one build thread for each processor to most efficiently build 
  your projects, but if this creates problems, it can limit the number of build 
  threads to just one. <code>ccache</code> is a program which speeds up 
  compilation and <code>fastdep</code> is a dependency checker which is several 
  orders of magnitude faster than the standard one. Tooltips are used sparingly 
  in Paladin, but if they annoy you, they can be turned off. When project files 
  are opened, Paladin can also open the folder that contains it in the Tracker 
  file browser. Also, if you have a preferred source control tool or would 
  rather not use it, you can set your preference here.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/PreferencesWindow.png" alt="Preferences window">

<h1 id="paledit" style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;">PalEdit, Paladin's Code Editor</h1>
  As of this writing, there isn't much difference between PalEdit and Pe, so the 
  documentation for Pe should be consulted for questions about its functions and 
  features. This section will be extended as it is developed further.<br>

<h1 id="appendix" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Appendix</h1>
<h2 id="adding-your-own-project-templates" style="margin-top: 5px;">Adding Your Own Project Templates</h2>
  By default, Paladin comes with a small group of project templates, but it is 
  possible &mdash; and easy &mdash; to create your own, as well. To create your 
  own project template:<br>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a new project in its own folder.</li>
    <li>Change the project settings to reflect your wishes.</li>
    <li>Add files to the project. Note that these files, including attributes, 
    will become the basis for your project template.</li>
    <li>Rename the project's folder to the name you wish to use for the template.</li>
    <li>Move the project folder to the Templates folder where Paladin is 
    installed. This is usually <code>/boot/apps/Paladin</code> or something 
    similar.</li>
  </ol>
  Once you have finished this series of steps, the next time you start Paladin, 
  it your new project template will be ready to use!

<h2 id="helper-tools" style="margin-top: 20px;">Helper Tools</h2>
  Developers seem to need a wide variety of tools when writing code. Paladin 
  includes a few small accessories to complement the main development 
  environment. They can be accessed from the Tools menu.

<h3 id="ascii-table" style="margin-top: 20px;">ASCII Table</h3>
  Paladin's ASCII table is pretty simple, but useful nonetheless. There are 
  hexadecimal, octal, and decimal values for each value from 0 to 255 along with 
  a description.

<h3 id="license-manager" style="margin-top: 20px;">License Manager</h3>
  Licensing is, unfortunately, a necessary evil. To help wade through the basic 
  differences of each license, the license manager provides a list of licenses, 
  a plain-language summary of the license, and the full text of the license 
  itself. Clicking on the Set License button creates a file called LICENSE in 
  your project's folder with the text of the license you have chosen.

<h3 id="project-backup" style="margin-top: 20px;">Project Backup</h3>
  Although source control is easy to come by and doesn't require much extra 
  effort, some projects hardly seem worth setting up a full-blown source control 
  repository. Your project can be quickly placed into a compressed archive in a 
  folder of your choosing with your project's name and timestamp for the backup 
  with just a click of this menu item.

<h3 id="regular-expression-tester" style="margin-top: 20px;">Regular Expression Tester</h3>
  <img src="images/RegExWindow.png" alt="RegEx window" style="float: right; padding-left: 9px;">
  <p>Regular expressions are both incredibly flexible and powerful. The only problem is getting them to work just right on a section of text. This window will provide the means to test a regular expression on some specified text. As a convenience, if there is text on the system clipboard when it is opened, it will start with that text as the data for the search.</p>
  <p>If you are not familiar with regular expressions, it is highly recommended that you learn about them. They can perform searches with more flexibility than regular string searches and the basics can be learned easily enough by reading <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/tutorial.html">a tutorial 
  on regular expressions</a>.</p>

<h3 id="symbol-finder" style="margin-top: 20px;">Symbol Finder</h3>
  With the many libraries that find their way onto each Haiku system, it is 
  quite easy to forget which shared library contains certain functions. The 
  Symbol Finder performs a search of all libraries kept in the system's library 
  folders and scans each one for the symbol searched for.
