Project File Format
=============================
The Paladin project is committed to open standards and cooperation with other 
software projects, hence its source code licensing and open file format, 
described below. Project files are simply text files with a format similar to 
.INI files found on Windows, with each line containing a <keyname>=<value> 
format. Order doesn't matter very much except in the case of project file 
listings as will be described in detail for the particular keys.

Key					Description
------------------------------------------
NAME				(deprecated in v1.1) Name of the project
TARGETNAME			The name of the final executable
PLATFORM			The name of the operating system version with which this 	
					project was last used. This can be R5, Haiku, HaikuGCC4, or 
					Zeta.
SCM					The project's source control tool. This can be svn for 
					Subversion or hg for Mercurial. If omitted, it is assumed 
					that no source control is used.
GROUP				Name of a source group. A project file must contain at least 
					one of these and each entry denotes a new group. SOURCEFILE 
					entries follow a GROUP line to define what files belong to 
					the named group.
EXPANDGROUP			Value is yes or no. If yes, the current group is expanded.
SOURCEFILE			The path of a source file in the project. If the path begins 
					with a slash, it is assumed to be an absolute path. If not, 
					it is assumed to be project relative
DEPENDENCY			This is an optional field. It is a list of files separated by 
					pipe symbols (|). It always follows the SOURCEFILE item it 
					describes.
LOCALINCLUDE		Include path for headers and libraries. Source files depend 
					on these to be able to find their headers.
SYSTEMINCLUDE		System folders which are used for includes. This is typically 
					for headers in the /boot/develop/headers folder hierarchy
LIBRARY				A library. Note that this is not limited to shared libraries 
					in the standard locations, but any library, including static 
					libraries kept in the project folder or anywhere else.
RUNARGS				Command-line arguments used when running the app
CCDEBUG				Value is yes or no. If yes, debugging info is compiled into 
					the target.
CCPROFILE			Value is yes or no. If yes, profiling info is compiled into 
					the target.
CCOPSIZE			Value is yes or no. If yes, optimization is done for size 
					over speed.
CCOPLEVEL			Value is an appropriate number for gcc's -O flag, ranging 
					from 0 to three.
CCTARGETTYPE		Value ranges from 0 to 3. 0 = application, 1 = shared 
					library, 2 = static library, 3 = kernel driver
CCEXTRA				Extra compiler options
LDEXTRA				Extra linker options
