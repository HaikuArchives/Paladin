Rework floater framework to take out all (or as much as possible) floater-related code out of the object framework

Add interface discovery for methods and events

Refactor PWindowBackend::QuitRequested -- move code out into an event. This depends on a way to respond to messages.

Test and fix PTextControl

Resizing a window doesn't update its values. The Update() method for the editor is called by the PropertyWindow, but it ends up getting the old value for the property instead of the new one. At that point, the value for Frame() doesn't return the right values. Is this a Haiku bug?

Will need to create a window for managing the application/project settings
