Add interface discovery for methods and events

Refactor PWindowBackend::QuitRequested -- move code out into an event.

Add a tooltip property for PView.

Implement a way to respond to messages via the event interface

Convert the following classes to use events:
	PBox
	PButton
	PCheckBox
	PLabel
	PListView
	PRadioButton
	PScrollBar
	PTextControl

Test and fix PTextControl

Resizing a window doesn't update its values. The Update() method for the editor is called by the PropertyWindow, but it ends up getting the old value for the property instead of the new one. At that point, the value for Frame() doesn't return the right values. Is this a Haiku bug?

Will need to create a window for managing the application/project settings
