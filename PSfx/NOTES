TODO:

Add save support for projects

Create icons for PSfx and its project files

Set up MIME handling stuff for project files and sfx files

Add an Alert for failed file opens

Implement custom directory handling in the ItemSelected code in PkgWindow

Test the packaging code -- the dependency on gPkgInfo has been removed. It all compiles, but there may easily be some regressions

The replacement mode code for PSelfExtract seems to be non-existent

The interface will pretty much be a direct copy of that of PackageBuilder.

Make a better About box
