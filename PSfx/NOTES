TODO:

Figure out how files will get into the zip file and how the zip file will get into the package file. Code for this does not exist in the PackageInfo class.

Add an Alert for failed file opens

Implement custom directory handling in the ItemSelected code in PkgWindow

Test the packaging code -- the dependency on gPkgInfo has been removed. It all compiles, but there may easily be some regressions

The replacement mode code for PSelfExtract seems to be non-existent

The interface will pretty much be a direct copy of that of PackageBuilder.

Make a better About box
