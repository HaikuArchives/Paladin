Paladin 1.0 Beta 1

Building Paladin is quite easy: open the BeIDE project and do a Make. Having rc installed is required for .rdef support.

PalEdit is almost as easy. Grab a copy of Haiku's version of jam and use the included jamfile. The BeIDE project will compile the project only after running the jam build unless you want to mess around with adding rez to the build rules (which I didn't). I only used it when I was debugging PalEdit. 

Caveats: 

- If you build PalEdit from the jamfile, you'll need to have libhekkel.so installed, which isn't a problem unless you also don't have pe.

- The build doesn't place any extensions or languages addons in the right place. This causes syntax highlighting to not work and no extensions to appear. You'll need to make a couple of symlinks to enable these -- Pe (and, by extension, PalEdit for the moment) look for them in subfolders -- Languages and Extensions, for obvious reasons.
