Changes in Paladin 1.4

New Features

User Interface
Files are now sorted first by type and then by name
New files or new file pairs added via Add New File are automatically added to source control
Changed key accelerators for common source control from Control + Alt to Control + Alt + Shift due to the newly-added window management shortcuts which clash with the old ones

Bugfixes
The dirty file count doesn't change during builds on SMP machines
Fixed a problem with files dropped from Tracker
Shell scripts are now executed properly
