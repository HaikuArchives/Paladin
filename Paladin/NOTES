TODO:
	Later: move SCM commands to using ShellHelper class for safety
	Bug: Files dropped from Tracker end up in the group above the one dropped on
	Bug: Dragging an item from one project to another causes a crash.
		Current code in the tree attempts to add the file, but nothing
		happens.

Features to implement / consider:
	Possibly implement a command-line-only build tool with more options or expand the current program's options
	A finished online import via SCM feature
	Tooltip for errors / warnings in the error window
	File rename command in project window (tied to SCM rename command)
	Add SymbolLocator to Tools menu
	Finish Haiku localization when Locale kit settles down
	Improve library window to handle such a large set of libraries in Haiku
	Add keyboard acceleration to library window
	Project-wide find-and-replace -- create Find in Project (Cmd+Shift+F)
	Rudimentary profiling
	Add New Class (add custom classes) - this one is quite hard!
	Code completion
	Find Definition (find in headers)
