TODO:
	Bug: where if you close the Settings window and run a build it hangs
	Use rsync to synchronize the code library.

Features to implement / consider:
	Find Definition (find in headers)
	Build-related options in an options class
	Add New Class (add custom classes) - this one is quite hard!
	BeHappy integration?
	Way to specify output folder for executable?
	Code completion
