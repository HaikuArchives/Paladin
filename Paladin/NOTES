TODO:
	Bug: Running the project after opening and closing the Project Settings window crashes the app -- project locked at the beginning of the build
	Exercise and test the SourceControl code for SVN, HG, and Git
	Add code to really help clean up the includes in a project -- no duplicates and project relative paths
	Add source control to imported projects
	Add a Start window checkbox to allow the user to use/not use source control.

Locale Kit notes:

Create text file for translators:
---------------------------------------------------
cpp *.cpp > preprocessed.cpp.tmp
collectcatkeys preprocessed.cpp.tmp -l english -o english.catkeys
rm preprocessed.cpp.tmp

Convert catalog to binary format for packaging and distribution
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
linkcatkeys english.catkeys -l english -s mimesignature -o english.catalog

Features to implement / consider:
	Tooltip for errors / warnings in the error window
	Add SymbolLocator to Tools menu
	Finish getting Haiku localization to work
	Import project from repository
	Improve library window to handle such a large set of libraries in Haiku
	Add keyboard acceleration to library window
	Project-wide find-and-replace -- create Find in Project (Cmd+Shift+F)
	Rudimentary profiling
	Add New Class (add custom classes) - this one is quite hard!
	Code completion
	Find Definition (find in headers)
