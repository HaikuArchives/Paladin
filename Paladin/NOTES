TODO:
	Issue: Printing output for hg push doesn't happen until after the fact
	Later: move SCM commands to using ShellHelper class for safety
	Need to handle password requests for SCMs.
	Bug: Files dropped from Tracker end up in the group above the one dropped on
	Bug: Dragging an item from one project to another causes a crash.
		Current code in the tree attempts to add the file, but nothing
		happens.
	Need to handle SCM setup -- bzr, hg, and git all require an e-mail address. The user should be asked what it is upon first use of any of these SCMs and have the information saved and re-used for each SCM.
	Adding a file to the project window via the New File window should add the file or file pair to source control

Features to implement / consider:
	Bazaar support
	CVS import support
	Possibly implement a command-line-only build tool with more options or expand the current program's options
	A finished online import via SCM feature
	Tooltip for errors / warnings in the error window
	File rename command in project window (tied to SCM rename command)
	Finish Haiku localization when Locale kit settles down
	Improve library window to handle such a large set of libraries in Haiku
	Add keyboard acceleration to library window
	Project-wide find-and-replace -- create Find in Project (Cmd+Shift+F)
	Rudimentary profiling
	Add New Class (add custom classes) - this one is quite hard!
	Code completion
	Find Definition (find in headers)
