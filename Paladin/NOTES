TODO:
	Exercise and test the SourceControl code for SVN, HG, and Git
	Add code to really help clean up the includes in a project -- no duplicates and project relative paths
	Add source control to imported projects

Features to implement / consider:
	Tooltip for errors / warnings in the error window
	Add SymbolLocator to Tools menu
	Finish Haiku localization when Locale kit settles down
	Improve library window to handle such a large set of libraries in Haiku
	Add keyboard acceleration to library window
	Project-wide find-and-replace -- create Find in Project (Cmd+Shift+F)
	Rudimentary profiling
	Add New Class (add custom classes) - this one is quite hard!
	Code completion
	Find Definition (find in headers)
