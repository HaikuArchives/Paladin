TODO:
	Create a lua-based grep so that regular expressions in the find box are compatible with the replacement program (grep's UNIX re vs luare's Lua re)
	Issue: Printing output for hg push doesn't happen until after the fact. This is mitigated by
		setting the preoutgoing hook in the [hooks] section of .hgrc to echo something.
	Need to handle password requests for SCMs.
	Bug: Dragging an item from one project to another causes a crash because of the
		assumptions made when the drag is performed -- pointers are used.
	Need to handle SCM setup -- bzr, hg, and git all require an e-mail address The user should
		be asked what it is upon first use of any of these SCMs and have the information saved
		and re-used for each SCM.
	Track down hardcoded path locations and replace them

Features to implement / consider:
	Bazaar support?
	CVS import support
	Possibly implement a command-line-only build tool with more options or expand the current
		program's options
	A finished online import via SCM feature
	Tooltip for errors / warnings in the error window
	File rename command in project window (tied to SCM rename command)
	Finish Haiku localization when Locale kit settles down
	Improve library window to handle such a large set of libraries in Haiku
	Add keyboard acceleration to library window
	Rudimentary profiling
	Add New Class (add custom classes) - this one is quite hard!
	Code completion
	Find Definition (find in headers)
