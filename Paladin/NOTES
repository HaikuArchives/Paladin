TODO:
	Bug: Running the project after opening and closing the Project Settings window crashes the app -- project locked at the beginning of the build
	Exercise and test the SourceControl code for SVN and HG
	Add code to really help clean up the includes in a project -- no duplicates and project relative paths
	Code Library cleanup:
		1) Scan for modules and save the item for each module file into a map of vectors.
		2) Run the rsync on a module as --list-only and parse the output to find out what files are updated.
		2b) If any of the changed files are new, add them to the project -- need to be able to specify a group
		2c) Run the rsync for real --> rsync -rX <user>/config/share/Paladin/CodeLibrary/<modulename>  <projectfolder>/ModuleFiles
		2d) Iterate through the module vector and see if any files disappeared. If they did, remove them from the project
	Add source control to imported projects
	Implement Git source control class

Locale Kit notes:

Create text file for translators:
---------------------------------------------------
cpp *.cpp > preprocessed.cpp.tmp
collectcatkeys preprocessed.cpp.tmp -l english -o english.catkeys
rm preprocessed.cpp.tmp

Convert catalog to binary format for packaging and distribution
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
linkcatkeys english.catkeys -l english -s mimesignature -o english.catalog

Features to implement / consider:
	Numeric shortcuts in Start window for choosing projects from the list
	Tooltip for errors / warnings in the error window
	Integrated version control via SVN, Git, and Mercurial
	Add SymbolLocator to Tools menu
	Finish getting Haiku localization to work
	Import project from repository
	Improve library window to handle such a large set of libraries in Haiku
	Add keyboard acceleration to library window
	Project-wide find-and-replace -- create Find in Project (Cmd+Shift+F)
	Rudimentary profiling
	Add New Class (add custom classes) - this one is quite hard!
	Code completion
	Find Definition (find in headers)
