About this version:

Wow. What a difference four months can make. There are so many little changes all over the app and one big change: integrated source control. It hasn't been done in an IDE for BeOS or Haiku yet, as far as I'm aware. This release also brings with it the change of development focus from cross-platform to specifically Haiku. The result has been a dramatically-improved user experience when working in the platform.

Frequently Asked Questions

Why another IDE for BeOS?

Because makefiles and jamfiles stink. One major reason why I am able to write code at all is because of the ease of use provided by BeIDE. It's not the best IDE out there, but it's a good one and if I'd had to learn to use makefile or jamfiles when I started out, I wouldn't have bothered. With Be, Inc. out of the picture, BeIDE isn't redistributable and still in the same state it was in March, 2000 when R5 was released. Paladin, on the other hand, is both and more.


What in the world is this 'license manager'?

For some people, dealing with software licensing is more than an annoyance -- it's a way of life. Few people don't want to have to deal with the chore of slogging through the legalese, either. The license manager allows you to look up a license, get a rough summary of what it really is all about, and also copy it into your project folder if you want to use it for your project. It's not intended to be a major feature, but it does have its uses.
