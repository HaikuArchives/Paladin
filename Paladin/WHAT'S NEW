New in Paladin 1.2

New Features

- Project templates
- Visual regular expression tester
- Added a fast Project Import feature to the Start Window
- Paladin now can use ccache for much faster rebuilds

User Interface

- Labels in the StartWindow are now clickable
- Added a button to the Error window to copy errors and warnings to the clipboard -- no more hidden functionality here!
- Added a file count to the status bar when building files
- Drag and drop reordering of groups (finally!)
- Library window shows right away even when there are lots of libraries in the system


Internal Fixes and Improvements

- Automatically define _ZETA_TS_FIND_DIR_ when building under Zeta to make using find_directory() under Zeta much less of a headache
- Fixed a bug in Find and Open File when working under Haiku
- Fixed a redraw problem with items in the Project Window under Haiku
- The logic for choosing which files to add to the project when dropping folders onto the project - window is a little more sensible
- Fixed a bug with Paladin sometimes spawning more build threads than necessary on multicore machines
