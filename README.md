SOME VERY USEFUL FEATURES

   DEALING WITH ERRORS
     
      While warnings will not stop Paladin from continuing to build a project, if an error           occurs, Paladin will stop the build so that the errors can be corrected. Errors are listed in pink; warnings are listed in yellow. Double-clicking on an error or warning will open up the file containing it in the editor. The Copy to Clipboard button will copy all visible errors and/or warnings to the system clipboard for pasting into other documents.

   BACKING UP PROJECTS

      Your project can be quickly placed into a compressed archive in a folder of your choosing with your project's name and timestamp for the backup with just a click of this menu item.
