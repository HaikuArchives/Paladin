Changes in Paladin 1.3

New Features
.rdef files are created with a form that can be filled in
Implemented fastdep dependency checking under Haiku
Source control is (optionally) integrated with projects now: SVN, and Hg
BeIDE projects can be opened and converted to Paladin projects


User Interface
Bring the Error window to the front when starting a build
The Terminal window now uses a fixed-width font
Better feedback when examining sources
Replaced internal tooltip code with OS-level ones. R5 tooltips are now completely gone. This fixes a few annoyances.
Dropping a Paladin project on a project window opens the project
Automatically add libsupc++ to new GUI projects under Haiku GCC4
Automatically remove libsupc++ from Haiku GCC4 projects under other platforms
Preferences window now reports the unavailability of external tools like fastdep and ccache
Start window has a keyboard shortcut to choose from the list -- Alt + number
New vector icon for project files
Removed the unnecessary quit button from start window
Opening a project from Terminal (like "Paladin myproject") now doesn't need the extension and works faster in some cases


Bugfixes
Edit Program Settings context menu action works for resource files under Haiku now
Worked around a bug in Haiku related to setting the type of a resource file created via Add New File.
Projects can no longer load a project more than once
Fixed Run in Debugger under Haiku
Resolved a bug in Haiku which caused hangs for multithreaded builds
Added a MIME sniffer rule to the Paladin project type to work around another MIME bug in Haiku
Fixed a bug with duplication of local include paths
Made some small fixes to the makefile generator
Paladin no longer bails on a command-line build when warnings are encountered

Internal changes
Tweaked the file filters for folder and project importing to exclude Jamfiles, Makefiles, and system folders for Git and Mercurial.
Improved error handling with the slow dependency updating code
Added some platform migration assistance -- libstdc++.r4.so, libsupc++.so in Haiku GCC4
A project's directory is now implicitly included in the list of include paths during builds
