Implement a ListValue class. It is needed for a number of different methods for stuff like BRoster's
methods and other stuff. It shouldn't accept anything except ListValue values.

Look into implementing a MapValue class, as well.

Finish PRoster class

Add Set/GetMode methods to PScreen

Redo PBitmap object. It can't be autogenerated because of the messiness involved in the backend,
such as handling "resizing" the bitmap and lazy allocation. Yuck.

Test and fix PTextControl problems

Implement a header for the constants for the HAIKU API, such as resizing modes, BView flags, etc.

Objects to Implement:

PBitmap
PCursor class and associated methods in PApplication
PDragger
PFont
PMenu
PMenuBar
PMenuField
PMessageRunner
POutlineListView
PPopUpMenu
PRoster
PShelf
PTabView

Classes to investigate further

BInvoker
BListItem
BMenuItem / BSeparatorItem
BMessageFilter
BPoint (PData?)
BRect (PData?)
BRegion (PData?)
BShape (PData?)
BShapeIterator
BStringItem

Probably Won't Implement
BScrollView
