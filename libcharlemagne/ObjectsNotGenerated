PBitmap - The interface between the object code and the backend is weird because of the way that it must interface with BBitmap
PNode - Lots of methods which require list data (GetAttrInfo, etc.)
PDragger - The backend is messy because it requires a BView target in the constructor and will not allow any changes.
PMessenger - Unlike BMessenger, PMessenger will be reusable. The backend is "disposable" and so it needs to be manually written
PShelf - Same reason as PShelf

PMenu/PMenuItem - Generated with manual tweaks -- backend definitions need to be in a shared header
