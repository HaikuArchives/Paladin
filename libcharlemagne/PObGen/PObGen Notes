PObGen Notes

Add support for defining data members

Add support for custom (embedded) headers

Add error handling code to detect problems in the specification

Make possible conditional substitution -- PView vs non-PView controls, for example


Spec-writing information

Read-only properties use an empty table for the SetProperty section of their entry definitions

Enumerated properties have the definitions of their types at index 7 of the entry

Need to add the check for PView inheritance to pass the proper constructor initialization

Embedded methods use "embedded" for the second entry in the method's definition entry. They
are then placed in a corresponding field in the PObject.embeddedMethods[] table.
